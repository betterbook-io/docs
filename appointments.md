## Getting Started
Setting up your online appointment bookings can be done in three easy steps:

1. Set up your services
2. Set up your staff and link them to services
3. Set up your booking page

### Setting up services
Any appointment involves a combination of services and (optionally) staff members.
When setting up your BetterBook profile, the services that your customers can book are 
configured so that it can be displayed on the booking page.

The following attributes can be configured for a service:
- Name & description
- Duration - the duration of the service in minutes/hours/days
- Price - the price in the local currency of the location
- Media gallery - this includes any photos or videos that you have to compliment your services.  
The media are made available on the booking page.


An appointment can combine any number of services, for example an appointment at a 
beauty parlor can be made that includes nail treatment, facial and skin care treatment, and tanning.
When combining services with different durations.
