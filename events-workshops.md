## Overview

This page gives an overview on taking online bookings for Workshops and Events. BetterBook allows setting up
once-off and recurring events which are then available for your customers to book online.

### Events, Scheduling and Bookings

Once you have [signed up](https://www.betterbook.io/signup) for a BetterBook account, you have access to the [BetterBook Portal](https://portal.betterbook.io)
and online apps.  Using the portal or the mobile app, you can configure your events.

At the most basic level, Events have the following attributes:
- Event name and description
- Start time & duration
- Media - any images or videos that you want to add to the event listing to improve the customer experience

There is a host of other options available that are easily configured using the [BetterBook Portal](https://portal.betterbook.io).


#### Bookings
When a booking is made, a branded confirmation email is sent to the customer with the event details.  You can customise the 
message of the email and include any attachments (totalling less than 10MB) that you want.

Managing the booking is easy from the [BetterBook Portal](https://portal.betterbook.io) or the mobile app.  You
can move the booking to a different workshop, or cancel the booking by following a few easy steps.  
Any update to a booking also triggers an email to be sent to the customer with details about the update.

If your event or workshop has limited seats, you can set the headcount limit for the event.  BetterBook will manage 
the headcount with every booking to make sure that the event is not overbooked.

### Taking Payments
If you want to take payments for your online bookings you need to have an account with one or more of our supported
payment providers:

- Stripe
- Flutterwave
- PayFast
- PayGate
- SnapScan

Once you have an account set up with a payment provider you need to configure your account details 
on BetterBook so that the payment integration can be activated.  This can easily be done using our [portal](https://portal.betterbook.io) or the mobile app.

When your customers make a booking, they will be .  The booking is only confirmed once BetterBook receives
confirmation that the payment has been successful, and once confirmed the customer is notified via email
of the booking details.

### Booking Page & Branding

Every BetterBook account comes with a hosted public booking page where your customers can access
your workshop/event and business information.  The booking page
 are fully customisable - you can add your own branding (e.g. a banner and your company logo).  

The page also provides an image gallery, a video section where you can embed a Youtube video, 
a Google Maps widget showing the location of the event and any extra information that
 you want your customers to see (like booking terms and conditions, refund & cancellation policies).
