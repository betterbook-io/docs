## Different ways to take bookings

### BetterBook Public Booking Page
Your BetterBook account comes with a ready to use booking profile where your customers
can view your company information, services and pricing, and make online bookings.  You can 
customise your company profile with a custom banner, logo, videos and a photo gallery. 

Your business profile address can be accessed by your customers directly
or shared with customers by having a `Call-to-Action` button
on your Facebook page.

An example of a unique company profile and booking page address:     
```
https://www.betterbook.io/listings/<unique-company-name>
``` 

The public booking page is fully customisable from the [BetterBook Portal](https://portal.betterbook.io).

### Wordpress plugin

BetterBook has a Wordpress plugin that allows the booking widget to be embedded into 
any Wordpress page or post.  You can read more about setting up the plugin [here](https://www.betterbook.io/docs/wordpress-plugin).

### Embeddable Widget
The BetterBook widget can be embedded into any existing website using a few lines of code.
